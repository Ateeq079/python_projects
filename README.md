# Python Projects

This repository contains a collection of **small, focused Python projects** built to practice real-world development concepts such as APIs, CLI tools, automation, and clean project structure.

Each project is self-contained and documented inside its own folder.

## 📁 Projects

### 1. GitHub Data CLI

**Folder:** `github-data/`

A command-line tool that fetches public GitHub user information using the **GitHub REST API**.

**What it does**

* Accepts a GitHub username from the terminal
* Fetches public profile data
* Displays formatted output in the CLI

**Example**

```bash
github-data torvalds
```

**Concepts covered**

* Python project structure
* Building CLI tools using **Click**
* Consuming REST APIs with `requests`
* Virtual environments
* Editable installs (`pip install -e .`)
* Packaging with `pyproject.toml`

This project focuses on understanding how real Python CLI tools (like `pip`, `black`, `flask`) are built and distributed.
