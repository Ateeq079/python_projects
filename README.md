Python Projects
This repository contains a collection of small, focused Python projects built to practice real-world development concepts such as APIs, CLI tools, automation, and clean project structure.

Each project is self-contained and documented inside its own folder.

📁 Projects
1. GitHub Data CLI
Folder: github-data/

A command-line tool that fetches public GitHub user information using the GitHub REST API.

What it does

Accepts a GitHub username from the terminal

Fetches public profile data

Displays formatted output in the CLI

Example


github-data  torvalds

Concepts covered

Python project structure

Building CLI tools using Click

Consuming REST APIs with requests

Virtual environments

Editable installs (pip install -e .)

Packaging with pyproject.toml

This project focuses on understanding how real Python CLI tools (like pip, black, flask) are built and distributed.

🛠 Tech Stack
Python

Click

Requests

GitHub REST API

2. Number Guessing Game (Python)
Folder: number-guessing-game/

A command-line based number guessing game written in Python.

What it does

Randomly generates a number within a defined range

Allows the user to select a difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard)

Limits the number of guesses based on difficulty

Provides feedback after each guess (too high / too low)

Ends the game when the number is guessed or attempts run out

Example


python  main.py

Concepts covered

Control flow (if/else, loops)

User input validation

Random number generation

Game logic and state management

Basic CLI interaction

This project focuses on strengthening core Python fundamentals, logical thinking, and clean control-flow design for beginner-level programs.

🛠 Tech Stack
Python (standard library)
🎯 Goal of This Repository
Build practical Python projects

Learn clean code organization

Gain hands-on experience with tooling and automation

Create portfolio-ready projects
